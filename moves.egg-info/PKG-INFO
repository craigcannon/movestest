        =====

        Requirements
        ------------
        
        * [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install via pip:
        
            pip install moves
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        See `examples/oauth.py` for some basic examples.
        
        You can request API endpoints like so:
        
            moves.api('/user/profile', 'GET', params={'access_token': access_token})
        
        Or
        
            moves.get('/user/profile', params={'access_token': access_token})
        
        Or just
        
            moves.user_profile(access_token=access_token)
        
        For endpoints that require RESTful parameters in the URL, such as `/user/summary/daily/<YYYYMMDD>`
        
            moves.user_summary_daily('20130605', access_token=access_token)
        
        All responses are decoded JSON objects.
        
        Consult the [API documentation](https://dev.moves-app.com/docs/api) for the methods supported.
